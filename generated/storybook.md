## Custom Storybook Configuration

You can supply your own storybook settings by adding a `.storybook` directory at the root of the project.

It supports the following files:

1. addons.js - configure addon loading. It acts exactly how a config.js works in storybook. Overrides the default addons.js
2. config.js - configure extra addons and load your stories. It acts exactly how a config.js works in storybook, just with all our default decorators and parameters. If using this you MUST load your stories or add this line "require('@design-systems/storybook/.storybook/defaultConfig');"
3. presets.js - configure storybook presets. It acts exactly how a presets.js works in storybook
4. webpack.config.js - configure extra webpack settings, works exactly like it does in storybook (ex: ({ config }) => config)
5. dark-logo.png - Logo for the storybook when it's in dark mode
6. light-logo.png - Logo for the storybook when it's in light mode
